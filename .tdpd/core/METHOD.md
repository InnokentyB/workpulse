# Test-Driven Product Development

Test-Driven Product Development (TDPD) is an original method by Innokenty Bodrov.

## Canonical pipeline

`Business problem → Approved product surface → Functional + quality specification → Architecture/risk plan → Specification Lock → User scenarios → E2E/quality tests → Agent implementation → Acceptance (UAT)`

1. Establish the actor, problem, desired outcome, and success signal.
2. Specify observable functional behavior and measurable quality attributes; plan architecture from those drivers, challenge it through security/failure review, and approve `LOCK-###` before final scenarios.
3. Describe real sequences of user actions and system responses, including applicable quality, hostile, failure, and recovery cases.
4. Convert every practical scenario into executable e2e and applicable QAR/risk/fitness tests before production implementation.
5. Let the implementation agent work within the approved architecture and autonomy boundary, after execution readiness is proven, until tests pass and each build has an honest `TRUN-###`.
6. Have a responsible human decide through UAT whether the result solves the original problem.

## Non-negotiable principles

- Reconcile contradictory sources before development.
- Treat an untestable scenario as a wish until it has an observable condition or is assigned to manual review.
- Treat an unspecified product surface as a blocking product decision. Never substitute a CLI or engineering interface for the intended experience.
- Exercise executable scenarios through the approved user surface; supporting API or CLI checks do not replace surface-level acceptance.
- Prove tests fail because behavior is absent before implementing it.
- Do not weaken tests merely to create green.
- Keep human judgment at architecture/risk input and UAT output instead of requiring line-by-line review of every agent rewrite.
- Do not finalize scenarios or enter Red until goal, functional, quality, architecture, risk, surface, and project readiness are locked.
- Report every required test case as passed, failed, errored, skipped, or not run; absence and infrastructure failure are not green.
- Preserve traceability from business value to acceptance evidence.
- Bind source-heavy delivery to a versioned Context Baseline and invalidate affected downstream artifacts when material evidence or decisions change.
- Scale Problem, Opportunity, and Input rigor using a Reliance & Harm preflight; require direct evidence and additional guardrails only when user dependency and consequences justify them.
- Require an approved Autonomy Contract before an agent may perform external or production side effects. Keep permissions least-privileged, actions attributable, blast radius bounded, and rollback owned.
- Prove Execution Readiness before implementation: the sandbox, tools, checks, environments, observability, stop conditions, and recovery path must work rather than merely exist on paper.
- Convert material UAT rejects, rollbacks, and escaped defects into Regression Memory: a scenario/test, a human-approved versioned rule, or an explicit manual-check decision.
- Measure accepted outcomes, human orchestration cost, UAT acceptance, rollback, and escaped defects instead of rewarding code volume or run duration alone.
- Never claim product value solely because automated tests pass.

## Evidence precondition

Apply [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) before committing the specification. TDPD does not treat input material as self-consistent: inventory sources, extract source-linked context, expose findings, record authorized decisions, freeze a Context Baseline, and preserve provenance through requirements, scenarios, tests, implementation, and UAT. A baseline identifies the evidence version being tested; it does not certify that evidence as true.

Apply [SPECIFICATION_ARCHITECTURE_ASSURANCE.md](SPECIFICATION_ARCHITECTURE_ASSURANCE.md) before final scenario drafting. A current approved Specification Lock proves that quality requirements, architecture, security, failure behavior, project boundaries, and human-owned tradeoffs are explicit enough that implementation need not invent them.

## Opportunity precondition

Apply [OPPORTUNITY.md](OPPORTUNITY.md) after framing the problem and before committing the specification. Use the cheapest credible experiment to test load-bearing assumptions. TDPD ensures disciplined delivery of a chosen product bet; it does not make an unvalidated bet valuable.

## Business and market precondition

Apply [BUSINESS_GTM.md](BUSINESS_GTM.md) before committing commercial, billing, entitlement, onboarding, or channel-dependent requirements. Validate the buyer/value exchange and bound economic uncertainty before delivery; validate the go-to-market path before launch.

## Product lifecycle extension

Apply [OUTCOMES.md](OUTCOMES.md) to define measurement before delivery and to govern launch and learning after UAT. Preserve the TDPD boundary: UAT is the human acceptance of delivered behavior; live outcome evidence determines whether to iterate, scale, hold, roll back, or sunset.

## Honest limits

Tone, perceived convenience, visual taste, and strategic value may require human judgment. Legacy products may need a narrow e2e adoption slice. When no practical executable boundary exists, label the work as a specification or UAT plan rather than completed TDPD.
